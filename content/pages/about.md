    text: >
      The Catalyst Centre is a pioneering youth-led institution dedicated to empowering Africa's next generation of leaders. We focus on tackling the continent's most pressing challenges: climate change, sustainable resource management, and the governance of critical minerals. Recognizing the potential of Africa's youth and the continent's role in the global energy transition, we equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and platforms needed to drive sustainable development and advocate for equitable resource governance.
