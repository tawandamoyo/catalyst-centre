In the hot and dry area of Nyamuzuwe, Mutoko rural, people from all walks of life (women, youth, men and traditional leaders), are furious as they fail to find answers to ‘who owns the black granite in their village?’, a place which they call their own. The villagers expressed their gross bitterness as they narrated how, since 1972, the God-given black granite natural resource has been unsustainably extracted from mother earth by foreigners without the ‘Bujas’ benefitting in any way. For the Mutoko inhabitants, the surrounding mountains endowed with massive deposits of black granite, are a symbol of their own heritage and pride.

These sentiments of bitterness were expressed during the inaugural District Alternative Mining Indaba (DAMI) to be held in rural Mutoko, where the black granite is being mined. The DAMI was held on the 2nd of October 2018 and attracted more than 350 villagers from 5 wards in Nyamuziwa. The Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (ZIMCODD) in collaboration with the Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) and Shine Faith Based Trust of Mutoko, held the DAMI pursuing the following objectives:

o To consolidate a resilient national extractives movement that responds to the sector’s challenges and engage duty bearers; and
o To create platforms for mining community to coalesce and discuss the impacts of the extractives on their livelihoods.

The Mutoko District Alternative Mining Indaba (DAMI) provided, for the first time, an organic platform for the Bujas to come together on a common cause to discuss, home-grown solutions to the curse of the black-granite in their area. An inclusive profile of villagers (women, youth, physically challenged and men) were actively participating throughout the various issues that were being interrogated, until a traditional figure, Headman Oscar Nyakabau, complemented that, “Hatisati takamboungana kuno kwaNyamuzuwe nenzira yakadai, pahukama hwedu, tichikurukurirana nhuna dzanetsamumusha, dzemakomo edu aparadzwa nevabvakure isu vane rukuvhute ruri mumakomo iwayo pasina kana chatawana”. The Bujas had a feel of owning the whole DAMI process.

Gender Relevance:
The negative impacts of extractivism impact men and women differently as women suffer the most due to their gender roles. The DAMI witnessed widowed women who lost their husbands due to work-place accidents in black granite mining. The widows did not receive any form of compensation from the miners and they continue to suffer the brunt of extractivism in the area. Amongst other issues affecting women are human rights violations, farm land dispossession, relocations and loss of landscape. It is therefore critical for mining communities (men and women) to convene in their localities in order to deliberate on issues affecting them and craft home-grown solutions to these predicaments.

The Bujas are bitter about:
o Not finding answers to the frequently asked question, ‘Whose mountain is it?, as their perceived right answer, ‘the Bujas’, has proved to be wrong all the time;
o Being denied their right to make decisions concerning the mountains that surround their homes;
o The devaluation of the black-granite and loss of revenue to the community as the Mutoko RDC receives a meagre USD$1/tonne.
o Black-granite mining that has left former mine workers weak, disabled, poor, susceptible to diseases and in some instances dead, due to the brutal nature with which the resource is being extracted;
o Mutoko villagers being engaged on manual and low-paid jobs at the mines whilst foreigners earn more for less exhaustive labour;
o Rampant child pregnancies in the area as foreigners impregnate school pupils;
o Reduced water tables and subsequent drying of rivers due to black-granite mining blasting that widens underground fissures;
o The undeveloped area of Nyamuzuwe that makes life in the area very expensive, especially transport, as motorists inflate fares to remedy wear and tear for their vehicles;
o The destruction of infrastructure and private property due to black-granite mining;
o The Chinese back-granite mining companies not remitting any taxes to Mutoko RDC since they started mining; and
o A cabal of Zimbabwean politicians conniving with black granite miners to siphon the natural resource (black-granite) out of Mutoko without any benefits for the community.
One would be forgiven to paint the Bujas’ case as gloomy. Far from it, the Bujas are brave, focused and determined to ensure that ‘Talk Shows’ are a thing of the past in Mutoko.

Challenges:

– As enthusiastic as they were, the participants realised that they lived in an environment that is politically volatile when some so called political dignitaries stormed into the community hall, where the DAMI was being held, and requested to greet the villagers for two minutes, which surprisingly became a campaign message for about ten minutes. However, it was clear that the Bujas are tired of being used for political gain by politicians without benefiting in any way whatsoever. They expressed their anger to the political activists by booing until the campaign message was abruptly ended, to the relief of the participants.

Conclusion
The levels of poverty in Mutoko are a clear indication of what the Left calls the resource curse. The resource curse, also known as the paradox of plenty, refers to the paradox that countries with an abundance of natural resources (like fossil fuels and certain minerals), tend to have less economic growth, less democracy, and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. As a pro-poor social justice activist movement, ZIMCODD will restlessly continue to execute the struggle for sustainable mining and pro-poor human development especially for mining communities such as Mutoko.
